# ICS-pcap

## What is this?
This is a collection of PCAPs (or additional notes where PCAPs are still needed) for ICS/SCADA utilities and protocols.

## How do I get it?
First, make sure that your git is updated. Second, you'll want to install GIT Large File Storage (LFS). 
- Go to https://git-lfs.github.com/ 
- Download the archive
- run the installer.
- git lfs clone https://github.com/NaInSec/ICS-pcap.git

## Would you like to contribute?
Feel free to submit pull requests with more PCAPs or info. If you see a mistake or would rather that I upload the PCAPs for you, create an issue and I'll do it for you.

## Disclaimer
If any of these are categorized incorrectly, please let me know. This is very possible due to mild caveats between similar protocols or variations of protocols.
